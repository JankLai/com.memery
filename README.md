# memeryPaging
My first Github project:
A java program to simulate memery paging processes with different algorithms;
Offerd several different paging algorithm;
A set of page numbers are given in the first place,what the algorithms do are to simulate paging,give all the page details of the memory when one page has
been changed in the memory,also shows the missing page numbers after the last page has been called;
